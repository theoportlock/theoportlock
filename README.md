# 👋 Hi, I'm Theo Portlock

I'm a researcher, developer, and systems thinker working at the intersection of AI, health, and resilience. My work brings together microbiome science, interpreted AI, and digital tools to tackle complex challenges — from early disease detection to adaptive infrastructure and heritage protection.

## 🌍 About Me

I lead **Portlock Lab**, a space for computational innovation in human and planetary health. Whether it’s designing microbiome-AI pipelines, building interactive tools for cultural heritage resilience, or visualizing complex systems — I’m driven by curiosity, clarity, and impact.

🧪 **Research interests**:  
- Microbiome and malnutrition  
- Interpretable machine learning  
- Digital heritage and disaster resilience  
- Data-driven policy tools for equity  

🛠️ **Technical focus**:  
- Python, Nextflow, R, Dash, Cytoscape  
- Workflow automation, containerisation, FAIR data  
- GraphML-based visual GUIs and metadata-driven pipelines
